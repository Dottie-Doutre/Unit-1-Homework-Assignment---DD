> ## Business Activities:
 
**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**

Since the global financial crisis in 2008, there has been a change in the way of financial markets, services and institutions when it comes to fraud and compliance. Frankieone looked at this issue at being the core of how fragmented the onboarding process currently was and looked to streamline it. This also addresses regulatory fines issues to major banks since 2017 (approx. $2B in fines).

They then developed a financial software that brings together a single unified API platform to manage KYC (Know You Customer), AML (Anti-money Laundering) and fraud cloud-based software.

They help banks, fintech and other companies’ that are regulated manage their regulatory compliance protocols through their single API and dashboard that connects to numerous (160+) global identity and fraud monitoring third party providers across the world.

Their SaaS (software as a service) allows their customers to scale and onboard customers providing a better and cost-effective user experience, in addition to potentially saving clients millions in possible regulatory fines as well as protecting customers from fraud. All through a user-friendly interface and portal.

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

Frankone’s target audience are all regulated agencies within the financial sector including banks, lenders and creditors. For example, their customer base includes Westpac, Volt, Frollo and AfterPay.

Example below (xviii) of Frankieone dashboard –

![image_add](image3.png)
 
**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**

The process is done by a single API (one decision engine) to determine fraud. It utilises 160+ sources to enable their customers to better decide with information regarding onboarding, financial risk and mitigating fraud.

Based on standard RESTful principles. This allows browser apps to communicate with a particular server via REST API (xix). Frankieone does this on the principal of passing JSON payloads over HTTPS to endpoints (verbs) as a form of sending data directly from the customer’s client.

Aims to keep the API easy and flexible by utilising only simple HTTPS verbs such as:

-	GET for recovering data 
-	POST for adding/updating 
-	DELETE for deleting data

This allows the customer to be flexible with their own flows and accommodate the API to best suit them.

User friendly technology with their Smart UI in allowing full customisation of their service. This is embedded as a reusable web component or “widget” (xviii). As the customer provides the necessary compliance information needed, either via a previously used customer ID and API key or authenticated to generate a secure temporary key it connects to Frankieone to begin the engine.

>## Landscape: 
 
**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**

* RegTech also known as Regulated technology 
-	Regulated technology is a broad term used to define any technology designed to help financial sector and for them with compliance and requirements set out by regulatory governments/bodies.

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**

Primary response to ongoing and increasing cost of compliance within RegTech due to new institutional demands by regulators and policymakers. Developments in this field was followed from the 2008 global financial crises which changed the nature of financial markets, services and institutions. 

This then caused a need for greater reporting accuracy, automation and decrease in compliance costs, identify risks and achieve compliance with real-time accuracy and cost-effective manner.
Also growing concern over money laundering and financial fraud and regulatory challenges COVID-19 pandemic presented including remote working, financial crime and cybersecurity.

RegTech takes advantage of the latest technologies including;

-	Cloud computing (such as Frankieone utilises)
-	Machine learning
-	Blockchain
-	Big data, data mining and analytics

Incorporating RegTech has a range of benefits (xiii):

-	Streamlining processes and automation
-	Cost-effectiveness
-	Fraud detection
-	Increased transparency
-	Risk reduction

The RegTech industry has growth exponentially since 2014 (xx) and estimated to have made $5 billion in 2018. The increased numbers of start-ups catalysed by regulatory change, interest and advancements in technology. Since then, it has developed distinct markets sections such as reporting and dashboards, risk analysis and profiling and due diligence.

Currently Australia is the third largest RegTech hub in the world (xxii), with US and the UK coming first and second respectively (as shown below). Even with the COVID-19 pandemic it is still expected to grow within this domain due to growing regulatory pressure.

 ![image_add](image5.png)

**What are the other major companies in this domain?**

-	Competitive market with approx. 80 established RegTech companies in Australia alone, making it the third largest in the world (i).
-	Other major companies in this field are 4Stop, Ascent, Dathena, Trunomi (xxi), Arctic Intelligence, Objective and Alloy (both in Australia and internationally).
-	Other fraud prevention services such as Alloy, Idwall, Rapyd and Stripe are also competitors (xxiii).

>## Results:
 
**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

-	Help businesses fight financial crime
-	Comply with regulatory requirements avoiding massive scale fines
-	Streamline the legally required range of onboarding checks and requirements
-	Increased efficiency and cost-save of ID verification processes
 
**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**

-	Awarded RegTech Export of the Year award 2021. Demonstrating global scalability and significant business growth.
•	Emerging Fintech Organisation of the Year
•	Excellence in RegTech
-	Frankieone has signed up 80 new customers in the last 18 months
-	International profile, greater adaptability as the service is not region specific.

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**

-	Frankieone has been one of the fastest growing RegTech private company
-	Vast interest from high profile investors
-	Gathered an international profile offered currently to 46 countries (xxiii).
-	Expansion of their APIs to look into monitoring of fiat and cryptocurrencies, giving Frankieone an edge around further developments on fraud detection.

>## Recommendations: 
 
**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**

As Frankieone already looks into the compliance of a customer it is only natural to be able to monitor a customer cashflow/transactions including fiat and cryptocurrency, in a more streamline and compliant manner as well.

Also streamline how this is reported to/for the customer to meet compliance guideline i.e., as outlined within the AUSTRAC guidelines. For example, trigger alerts when size, frequency and/or patterns of transactions indicates unusual activity (xxiv).

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

It can add another layer towards fraud and AML detection. Especially for large scale businesses.
This will then be able to branch out into most fields within the financial sector, accounting and auditing firms. Adds further diversification to their service portfolio.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**

Frankieone already implements a lot of technologies utilised by transaction monitoring processes i.e., biometric technology. The use of machine learning may be implemented to help further develop the single API engine that is already utilised to streamline this service.

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**

Allows the API to consistently monitor and automate activity and irregularities when they occur, as this will be churning through large scale size of data (xxv). Improvements to real-time monitoring for customers, which will reduce operational and compliance costs.
